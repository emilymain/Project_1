#Music Theory Game - Test Your Sight Reading Skills!



###The Idea Behind The Game
Music has always been a big part of my life. Many of my friends work as music educators in public schools all over the country and most of their complaints are about the amount of time that they have to teach both theory and actually start practicing/rehearsing. One of the many problems with Arts Education taking the back-seat for many school districts is that they don't have enough time to go over music theory lessons in addition to getting to practice with their classes. This issue in time and resources for music education has inspired this basic music sight reading game.

The game will display an image of a musical note on the staff and the player will have to press the correct key on the piano in order to move forward with the game. If they do not press the correct key for the note displayed in the image, they will have three attempts to get the correct answer. If they do not get the answer correctly, they will be shown the answer in addition to being notified that they lost. The game will have a reset button and they can try again. 

####MVP
* Create the game design in HTML and CSS
* Create the music theory images in Adobe illustrator. 
* Once the layout is complete have images correspond with event listeners to the seperate keys on the piano. 
* If the user gets the correct key with the note, they will have a new image appear for them to play in addition to being notified they got the answer correct.  
* If the user clicks the wrong key, they will have three chances to get the answer correct. 
* An alert will come up with each wrong attempt, prompting the user to try again. 
* After 3 wrong attempts the user will be informed that they lost the game. 
* After 10 correct answers the user will win that round of the game.
